# About

## What is this?

This is a website where you can view and bookmark the [Official Side Event List for Korea Blockchain Week (KBW) 2024](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1k1xAFaLQ5nYnWVDPPvrme-iVUzfSgHJLyt5fGng7KZc/edit?gid=0#gid=0).

<!-- ## Why did you build this?

I've been attending KBW for the past few years, and each time there are over 100 Side Events, with the number growing year by year.

While the KBW organizers distribute [Side Event List Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1k1xAFaLQ5nYnWVDPPvrme-iVUzfSgHJLyt5fGng7KZc/edit?gid=0#gid=0) annually, it's challenging to get a quick overview of the events. Moreover, since it's a public sheet, it's not convenient to bookmark events you're personally interested in. It's also time-consuming to manually add these events to your calendar.

That's why I created this website. -->

## How does this work?

This website displays the same content as the [KBW 2024 Official Side Event List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1k1xAFaLQ5nYnWVDPPvrme-iVUzfSgHJLyt5fGng7KZc/edit?gid=0#gid=0) and automatically syncs with it every hour.

## How can I contribute?

To add a new event, press the + button in the top right corner.
